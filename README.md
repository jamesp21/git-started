First challenge for the INFO343 course

Thank you for taking time out of your life to teach me something cool and fun.

*I think it's cool that you also wrestled in high school and no matter what, eventhough you didn't go to state, i know you were a great wrestler!*

Since you like Bluegrass i will add this: **Late in the evening about sundown, High on the hill above the town, Uncle Pen played the fiddle, Lord, how it would ring, You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing** - Bill Monroe
